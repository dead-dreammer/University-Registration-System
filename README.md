The program manages students, courses, and rooms and handles the process of student enrollment into courses. The system prioritizes student enrollment based on academic year, and allocates rooms and timeslots for courses. It uses a priority queue to manage registration requests and ensures that courses are scheduled in suitable rooms based on the course's requirements.

How the Program Works:

-Students are represented by their ID, major, courses they are enrolled in, and academic year.

-Courses include course code, name, maximum capacity, room type, and scheduled time slots.

-Rooms have a specific type, capacity, available time slots, and special equipment (like projectors).

-Scheduling System manages the courses, rooms, and students. It processes registration requests from students, ensuring that they are enrolled into courses and assigned rooms with available timeslots.

-The registration requests are processed based on the student's academic year (higher academic years have higher priority), and the available time slots are matched to the courseâ€™s needs.
